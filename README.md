### Hi there ,You can call me "Y Wine". üëã

# üí´ About Me:
‚úåÔ∏è üëª, Oh, in case I don‚Äôt see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.<br>‚ò†Ô∏è I am currently working on.....<br>ü§ñ I am presently learning...<br>üçÄ I am just a boy with a positive mindset..üëª‚úåÔ∏è<br>I am an ordinary happy young man. <br>There were no great thoughts in my head, I have had a few good things in my life. I'm not angry about it. Sometimes when people say I'm wrong, I learn. <br>Then I try to be good. And I don't want to be an outstanding person. I don't want to be the wrong person. I always want to be kind and help people, I want to be solid and pure-minded. <br>There are things I want to do while I'm alive, and I'll try to get them done, and I'll give a little help to those who don't know what life is. If I die, if my family remembers me, that is enough for me. Finally, I would like to thank those who put in such thoughts. <br>Life is short, and you have to choose how you live. That's it.
